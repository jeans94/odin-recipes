      <li>1 (6 pound) boneless prime rib roast</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons Dijon mustard</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
      <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 carrot, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
      <li>1 small unpeeled onion, quartered and separated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        The day before serving, remove the roast from the package and dry
        thoroughly with paper towels. Set roast on a baking sheet, and place in
        refrigerator overnight. Remove from refrigerator 1 hour before cooking
        to allow meat to reach room temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rub the roast all over with horseradish and Dijon mustard. Mix kosher
        salt, black pepper, thyme, and garlic powder together in small bowl;
        sprinkle over the roast.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Place celery, carrot,
        and onion into the bottom of a roasting pan; place the roast on top.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to
        350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and roast until the meat is browned and
        an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the
        roast reads 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from oven, transfer roast to a platter, and cover with a tent of
        aluminum foil. Allow to rest for 30 minutes. The temperature of the meat
        will rise about 10 degrees during resting time.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make au jus sauce: Skim excess fat from pan drippings in the roasting
        pan. Place the pan over a burner set to medium heat; stir in beef base
        and 1 1/2 cups of water. Bring to a boil, scraping and dissolving any
        brown flavor bits from the bottom of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Strain out and discard vegetables. Combine cornstarch and 1 teaspoon of
        water in a small bowl; whisk the mixture into sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow sauce to thicken slightly; pour into a gravy boat and serve with
        roast.
      </li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
