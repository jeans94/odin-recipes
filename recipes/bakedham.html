    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 cup maple syrup</li>
      <li>1 cup orange juice</li>
      <li>1 cup ginger ale</li>
      <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 box round wooden toothpicks</li>
      <li>½ cup honey</li>
      <li>1 (10 ounce) jar maraschino cherries, halved</li>
      <li>1 (12 pound) fully-cooked, bone-in ham</li>
      <li>
        1 large heat-resistant nylon oven bag (such as Reynolds Oven Bags)
      </li>
      <li>1 (15.25 ounce) can pineapple slices in juice, drained</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix maple syrup, orange juice, ginger ale, brown sugar, and honey
        together in a medium bowl. Stir in juice from maraschino cherries, and
        1/2 of the cherries.
      </li>
      <li>
        Score the outer edge of the ham with a sharp knife in a diamond pattern.
        Cuts should be about 1/4 inch deep to allow the ham to soak up the
        juice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place ham into an oven bag, and carefully pour the juice mixture over
        it, keeping all of the juice in the bag (it may look like there is too
        much juice, but the ham will soak it up while baking).
      </li>
      <li>
        Place pineapple slices on top of ham, and secure with toothpicks. Place
        cherries into the center of pineapple rings, and secure with toothpicks
        also. Tie the end of the bag closed with the ties provided, place in a
        large roasting pan, and cut a few small slits in the top of the oven
        bag.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake ham for 2 hours in the preheated oven. The internal temperature
        should be 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) when done. Be sure not to touch
        the bone when taking the temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove ham from bag to a serving plate, and let stand for 10 minutes
        before carving.
      </li>
    </ol>
