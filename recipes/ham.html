    <h2>Savor the Affordable Elegance: A Honey-Glazed Ham Delight</h2>

    <p>
        This honey-glazed ham boasts a flavor profile reminiscent of the renowned honey-baked ham, yet it comes with a more budget-friendly price tag. The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity and convenience â€“ no need to navigate through holiday crowds. Opting for pre-sliced ham streamlines the process, offering a preparation that closely mirrors the original. It's a delightful addition to any meal, and I often prepare it simultaneously with the rest of the dishes to ensure a flavorful baste without the risk of forgetting amidst the kitchen hustle.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Ham: This recipe calls for one 5-pound ready-to-eat ham. If your ham is larger or smaller, you'll need to adjust the recipe.</li>
            <li>Cloves: Aromatic whole cloves add warm, spicy-sweet flavor.</li>
            <li>Honey: Of course, you'll need honey. Pro-tip: Spray your measuring cup with cooking spray so the honey slides out easily.</li>
            <li>Corn Syrup: Dark corn syrup adds more flavor and contributes to caramelization. Some reviewers suggest substituting brown sugar or using a combination of corn syrup and brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Butter: Butter adds and helps retain moisture, resulting in a juicy honey-baked ham that's impossible to resist.</li>
        </ul>
