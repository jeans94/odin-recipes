    <h2>Savor the Affordable Elegance: A Honey-Glazed Ham Delight</h2>

    <p>
        This honey-glazed ham boasts a flavor profile reminiscent of the renowned honey-baked ham, yet it comes with a more budget-friendly price tag. The beauty of this recipe lies in its simplicity and convenience – no need to navigate through holiday crowds. Opting for pre-sliced ham streamlines the process, offering a preparation that closely mirrors the original. It's a delightful addition to any meal, and I often prepare it simultaneously with the rest of the dishes to ensure a flavorful baste without the risk of forgetting amidst the kitchen hustle.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 (5 pound) ready-to-eat ham</li>

            <li>¼ cup whole cloves</li>

            <li>¼ cup dark corn syrup </li>

            <li>2 cups honey</li>

            <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).</li>
            
            <li>Score ham, and stud with the whole cloves. Place ham in foil lined pan.</li>
            
            <li>In the top half of a double boiler, heat the corn syrup, honey and butter. Keep glaze warm while baking ham.</li>

            <li>Brush glaze over ham, and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes in the preheated oven.</li>

            <li>Baste ham every 10 to 15 minutes with the honey glaze. During the last 4 to 5 minutes of baking, turn on broiler to caramelize the glaze. Remove from oven, and let sit a few minutes before serving.</li>

            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
