Odin Recipes Journey

Hey fellow learners!

I'm excited to share my journey with you as I dive into The Odin Project's Foundations course. Currently, I'm working on a project called "Odin Recipes," and here's the lowdown on what it's all about and why I'm doing it.

Project Overview
The Odin Recipes project is a hands-on opportunity to put my HTML skills into practice. The goal is to build a basic recipe website. Right now, it might not look like a culinary masterpiece in terms of design – we're saving the aesthetics for a later date when we get to sprinkle in some CSS magic.

Why This Project?
Strengthening HTML Chops: This project is the perfect playground to reinforce my understanding of HTML. Iteration by iteration, I'll be crafting the structure of the website and gaining confidence in my HTML skills.

GitHub Portfolio: The Odin Project emphasizes organizing projects like a portfolio. By linking my projects to GitHub, I'm not only following best practices but also showcasing my progress to the wider coding community.

Setting Up on GitHub
I've kicked things off by creating a repository on GitHub called "odin-recipes." It's a public repository, allowing anyone interested to peek into my coding journey. I've cloned it to my local machine, and I'm ready to roll.

README.md Introduction
I've taken a moment to set up my README.md file. It's not just a technical document; it's my way of introducing the project to others. I've shared a brief overview of what the project entails and what skills I aim to demonstrate upon completion. It's a snapshot of my coding journey.

Iterations Breakdown
Iteration 1: Initial Structure
In this step, I've laid the groundwork by creating the main index page with an "Odin Recipes" heading. It's the starting point for something that will hopefully become a hub of culinary delights.

Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Now, I'm diving into creating individual recipe pages. Each page will have an "<h1>" heading with the recipe's name, and I've linked them back to the main index page.

Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
The recipe pages are getting more substance – images, descriptions, ingredient lists, and step-by-step instructions. It's not just about structure; it's about creating a holistic experience for anyone exploring these recipes.

Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Variety is the spice of life! I'm expanding the repertoire by adding two more recipes. Keeping it neat, I've organized the links in an unordered list for better readability.

This project might not look as polished as some others out there, but that's okay. I'm here to learn, to progress, and to build a foundation that I can enhance in the future.

Thanks for joining me on this coding adventure! If you're working on something similar or have tips to share, feel free to connect.

Happy coding!
